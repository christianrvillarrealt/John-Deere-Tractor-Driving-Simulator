The agricultural sector and its products are a cornerstone of the sustainability of human survival and activity due to its provision of energy and nutrients required by the human population scattered all across the world. In this project, we collaborated with John Deere, one of the most important global corporations in this sector, and delved into programmable logic devices, with an FPGA as the main tool for digital design.

The design of a user interface composed of a configurable logic device, the **Field Programmable Gate Array**, provided two useful tools and a unique enriching experience for the creation of prototypes necessary to validate ideas, concepts, and solutions to real world problems. The **DE-10 Lite FPGA** was fundamental in our project and facilitated the creation of electronic device prototypes with embedded systems in an efficient and economic form. FPGAs allow for configuration and re-configuration of hardware according to the specified needs of the project without the need to manufacture multiple testing chips. This not only optimized our resources, but also opened us to a wide array of opportunities for innovation and practical learning, essential in the technological industry.

For the creation of the software environment of the simulation, we used **Unity**, widely used for videogame development. In addition, to manage version control of the final product and the advancement of multiple conforming aspects of the project, we used **Plastic SCM**. By using these tools, we maintained constant and structured progress and fluid and efficient collaboration.

## State Machine

Finally, a logic state machine was created to represent the behavior of our game implemented in **Quartus Prime** with **Very High Level Descriptive Language**, better known as **VHDL**.
